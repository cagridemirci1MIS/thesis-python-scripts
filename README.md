Overview

This repository contains the original Python scripts developed for my MSc thesis research on multilingual and sociolinguistic analysis of digital communication.
All scripts were independently written and used to collect, preprocess, and analyze textual data for the study.
They reflect my own approach to data-driven linguistic inquiry, emphasizing reproducibility, transparency, and ethical data handling.

Contents

Data Collection: Scripts for retrieving social media text via APIs.

Preprocessing: Tools for cleaning, tokenizing, and normalizing multilingual text.

Feature Extraction: Code for word frequency analysis, TF-IDF vectorization, and embedding generation.

Modeling: Experiments with supervised and unsupervised algorithms (e.g., SVM, NMF, Logistic Regression).

Evaluation: Performance measurement, visualization, and interpretability tools.

Usage

Each script is self-contained and documented with inline comments for clarity.
You can run the scripts in standard Python environments (Python ≥3.9).

# Example: run preprocessing
python preprocess_texts.py


Dependencies are listed in requirements.txt.
The scripts were originally developed in Jupyter Notebook and later exported to .py for archival.

Ethical Statement

All analyses were conducted using publicly available or anonymized data.
The code avoids reproducing or storing any personally identifiable information (PII).
